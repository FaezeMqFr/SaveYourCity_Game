# 🌊 Save Your City! – Flood Protection Game
An **interactive, browser‑based game** that introduces flood‑risk management
and climate‑resilience concepts through hands‑on resource allocation and
decision‑making.

# ✨ Key Features
- Dynamic Weather         – Real‑time forecasts with stochastic storm events.<br>
- Resource Management     – Strategic trade‑offs between short‑term fixes<br>
                           and long‑term resilience within a finite budget.
- Multiple Strategies     – Sandbags, green infrastructure, flood walls,<br>
                           each with its own cost–benefit profile.
- Reward Mechanics        – Bonuses for sustainable, forward‑thinking choices.
- Adaptation Tracking     – Dashboards for protection value, budget, and risk.


# 🎮 How to Play
1) Check the Forecast     – Each round begins with a weather outlook.<br>
2) Select Protections     – Allocate funds among:<br>
   · Sandbags       – Low cost | Moderate protection | Minor upkeep<br>
   · Trees & Parks  – Medium cost | Good protection | Eco‑benefits<br>
   · Flood Wall     – High cost | Strong protection | Significant upkeep<br>
3) Face the Weather       – See how your city withstands the event.<br>
4) Collect Bonuses        – Rewards for sustainable, cost‑effective decisions.<br>
5) Repeat                 – Continue until funds (or risk tolerance) run out.<br>
